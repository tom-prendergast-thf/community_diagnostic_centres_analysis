### QUESTION 3: HOW DO DIAGNOSTIC WAITING TIMES COMPARE BETWEEN AREAS WITH AND WITHOUT CDCs?


# Step 1: In joined DM01/CDC data, create an additional variable which flags which trusts have a CDC associated with them, and which do not


# Step 2: A simple comparison of the distribution of waiting times for each test between trusts which have a CDC compared to those which don't, first presented in the aggregate.  
# There are a few different ways of approaching this - waiting times can be treated as a categorical variable, as they are presented in the data, or they can be 
# converted into numbers. If converting to numbers, box and whisker graphs would be a good way to compare. 


# Step 3: Create a scatter plot (trust and test level) of average waiting times vs proportion of activity performed by CDCs.
# Waiting times will need to be numeric to compute averages. If a lot of trusts have no associated CDC, it may be an idea to only look at trusts with CDCs. 



# Step 4: Difference-in-difference comparisons? We'll discuss this when I'm back from leave
